/**
 * A capability-based lock with three modes for controlling read/write
 * access.  The state of a StampedLock consists of a version and mode.
 * Lock acquisition methods return a stamp that represents and
 * controls access with respect to a lock state; "try" versions of
 * these methods may instead return the special value zero to
 * represent failure to acquire access. Lock release and conversion
 * methods require stamps as arguments, and fail if they do not match
 * the state of the lock. The three modes are:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 *  <li><b>Writing.</b> Method {@link #writeLock} possibly blocks
 *   waiting for exclusive access, returning a stamp that can be used
 *   in method {@link #unlockWrite} to release the lock. Untimed and
 *   timed versions of {@code tryWriteLock} are also provided. When
 *   the lock is held in write mode, no read locks may be obtained,
 *   and all optimistic read validations will fail.  </li>
 *
 *  <li><b>Reading.</b> Method {@link #readLock} possibly blocks
 *   waiting for non-exclusive access, returning a stamp that can be
 *   used in method {@link #unlockRead} to release the lock. Untimed
 *   and timed versions of {@code tryReadLock} are also provided. </li>
 *
 *  <li><b>Optimistic Reading.</b> Method {@link #tryOptimisticRead}
 *   returns a non-zero stamp only if the lock is not currently held
 *   in write mode. Method {@link #validate} returns true if the lock
 *   has not been acquired in write mode since obtaining a given
 *   stamp.  This mode can be thought of as an extremely weak version
 *   of a read-lock, that can be broken by a writer at any time.  The
 *   use of optimistic mode for short read-only code segments often
 *   reduces contention and improves throughput.  However, its use is
 *   inherently fragile.  Optimistic read sections should only read
 *   fields and hold them in local variables for later use after
 *   validation. Fields read while in optimistic mode may be wildly
 *   inconsistent, so usage applies only when you are familiar enough
 *   with data representations to check consistency and/or repeatedly
 *   invoke method {@code validate()}.  For example, such steps are
 *   typically required when first reading an object or array
 *   reference, and then accessing one of its fields, elements or
 *   methods. </li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This class also supports methods that conditionally provide
 * conversions across the three modes. For example, method {@link
 * #tryConvertToWriteLock} attempts to "upgrade" a mode, returning
 * a valid write stamp if (1) already in writing mode (2) in reading
 * mode and there are no other readers or (3) in optimistic mode and
 * the lock is available. The forms of these methods are designed to
 * help reduce some of the code bloat that otherwise occurs in
 * retry-based designs.
 *
 * <p>StampedLocks are designed for use as internal utilities in the
 * development of thread-safe components. Their use relies on
 * knowledge of the internal properties of the data, objects, and
 * methods they are protecting.  They are not reentrant, so locked
 * bodies should not call other unknown methods that may try to
 * re-acquire locks (although you may pass a stamp to other methods
 * that can use or convert it).  The use of read lock modes relies on
 * the associated code sections being side-effect-free.  Unvalidated
 * optimistic read sections cannot call methods that are not known to
 * tolerate potential inconsistencies.  Stamps use finite
 * representations, and are not cryptographically secure (i.e., a
 * valid stamp may be guessable). Stamp values may recycle after (no
 * sooner than) one year of continuous operation. A stamp held without
 * use or validation for longer than this period may fail to validate
 * correctly.  StampedLocks are serializable, but always deserialize
 * into initial unlocked state, so they are not useful for remote
 * locking.
 *
 * <p>The scheduling policy of StampedLock does not consistently
 * prefer readers over writers or vice versa.  All "try" methods are
 * best-effort and do not necessarily conform to any scheduling or
 * fairness policy. A zero return from any "try" method for acquiring
 * or converting locks does not carry any information about the state
 * of the lock; a subsequent invocation may succeed.
 *
 * <p>Because it supports coordinated usage across multiple lock
 * modes, this class does not directly implement the {@link Lock} or
 * {@link ReadWriteLock} interfaces. However, a StampedLock may be
 * viewed {@link #asReadLock()}, {@link #asWriteLock()}, or {@link
 * #asReadWriteLock()} in applications requiring only the associated
 * set of functionality.
 *
 * <p><b>Sample Usage.</b> The following illustrates some usage idioms
 * in a class that maintains simple two-dimensional points. The sample
 * code illustrates some try/catch conventions even though they are
 * not strictly needed here because no exceptions can occur in their
 * bodies.<br>
 *
 *  <pre>{@code
 * class Point {
 *   private double x, y;
 *   private final StampedLock sl = new StampedLock();
 *
 *   void move(double deltaX, double deltaY) { // an exclusively locked method
 *     long stamp = sl.writeLock();
 *     try {
 *       x += deltaX;
 *       y += deltaY;
 *     } finally {
 *       sl.unlockWrite(stamp);
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   double distanceFromOrigin() { // A read-only method
 *     long stamp = sl.tryOptimisticRead();
 *     double currentX = x, currentY = y;
 *     if (!sl.validate(stamp)) {
 *        stamp = sl.readLock();
 *        try {
 *          currentX = x;
 *          currentY = y;
 *        } finally {
 *           sl.unlockRead(stamp);
 *        }
 *     }
 *     return Math.sqrt(currentX * currentX + currentY * currentY);
 *   }
 *
 *   void moveIfAtOrigin(double newX, double newY) { // upgrade
 *     // Could instead start with optimistic, not read mode
 *     long stamp = sl.readLock();
 *     try {
 *       while (x == 0.0 && y == 0.0) {
 *         long ws = sl.tryConvertToWriteLock(stamp);
 *         if (ws != 0L) {
 *           stamp = ws;
 *           x = newX;
 *           y = newY;
 *           break;
 *         }
 *         else {
 *           sl.unlockRead(stamp);
 *           stamp = sl.writeLock();
 *         }
 *       }
 *     } finally {
 *       sl.unlock(stamp);
 *     }
 *   }

 *
 *  StampedLock具有三种模式：写模式、读模式、乐观读模式。
 *  乐观读，它是指当乐观读时假定没有其它线程修改数据，读取完成后再检查下版本号有没有变化，没有变化就读取成功了，这种模式更适用于读多写少的场景。
 *
 *  问题
 * （1）StampedLock是什么？
 *
 * （2）StampedLock具有什么特性？
 *
 * （3）StampedLock是否支持可重入？
 *
 * （4）StampedLock与ReentrantReadWriteLock的对比？
 * 读锁（悲观）的使用方式可以进行升级，通过tryConvertToWriteLock()方式可以升级为写锁

     * Algorithmic notes:
     *
     * The design employs elements of Sequence locks
     * (as used in linux kernels; see Lameter's
     * http://www.lameter.com/gelato2005.pdf
     * and elsewhere; see
     * Boehm's http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2012/HPL-2012-68.html)
     * and Ordered RW locks (see Shirako et al
     * http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2312015)
     *
     * Conceptually, the primary state of the lock includes a sequence
     * number that is odd when write-locked and even otherwise.
     * However, this is offset by a reader count that is non-zero when
     * read-locked.  The read count is ignored when validating
     * "optimistic" seqlock-reader-style stamps.  Because we must use
     * a small finite number of bits (currently 7) for readers, a
     * supplementary reader overflow word is used when the number of
     * readers exceeds the count field. We do this by treating the max
     * reader count value (RBITS) as a spinlock protecting overflow
     * updates.
     *
     * Waiters use a modified form of CLH lock used in
     * AbstractQueuedSynchronizer (see its internal documentation for
     * a fuller account), where each node is tagged (field mode) as
     * either a reader or writer. Sets of waiting readers are grouped
     * (linked) under a common node (field cowait) so act as a single
     * node with respect to most CLH mechanics.  By virtue of the
     * queue structure, wait nodes need not actually carry sequence
     * numbers; we know each is greater than its predecessor.  This
     * simplifies the scheduling policy to a mainly-FIFO scheme that
     * incorporates elements of Phase-Fair locks (see Brandenburg &
     * Anderson, especially http://www.cs.unc.edu/~bbb/diss/).  In
     * particular, we use the phase-fair anti-barging rule: If an
     * incoming reader arrives while read lock is held but there is a
     * queued writer, this incoming reader is queued.  (This rule is
     * responsible for some of the complexity of method acquireRead,
     * but without it, the lock becomes highly unfair.) Method release
     * does not (and sometimes cannot) itself wake up cowaiters. This
     * is done by the primary thread, but helped by any other threads
     * with nothing better to do in methods acquireRead and
     * acquireWrite.
     *
     * These rules apply to threads actually queued. All tryLock forms
     * opportunistically try to acquire locks regardless of preference
     * rules, and so may "barge" their way in.  Randomized spinning is
     * used in the acquire methods to reduce (increasingly expensive)
     * context switching while also avoiding sustained memory
     * thrashing among many threads.  We limit spins to the head of
     * queue. A thread spin-waits up to SPINS times (where each
     * iteration decreases spin count with 50% probability) before
     * blocking. If, upon wakening it fails to obtain lock, and is
     * still (or becomes) the first waiting thread (which indicates
     * that some other thread barged and obtained lock), it escalates
     * spins (up to MAX_HEAD_SPINS) to reduce the likelihood of
     * continually losing to barging threads.
     *
     * Nearly all of these mechanics are carried out in methods
     * acquireWrite and acquireRead, that, as typical of such code,
     * sprawl out because actions and retries rely on consistent sets
     * of locally cached reads.
     *
     * As noted in Boehm's paper (above), sequence validation (mainly
     * method validate()) requires stricter ordering rules than apply
     * to normal volatile reads (of "state").  To force orderings of
     * reads before a validation and the validation itself in those
     * cases where this is not already forced, we use
     * Unsafe.loadFence.
     *
     * The memory layout keeps lock state and queue pointers together
     * (normally on the same cache line). This usually works well for
     * read-mostly loads. In most other cases, the natural tendency of
     * adaptive-spin CLH locks to reduce memory contention lessens
     * motivation to further spread out contended locations, but might
     * be subject to future improvements.
